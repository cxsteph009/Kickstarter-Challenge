# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
Louise owns Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform that funds and supports various campaigns all over the world. We were provided data that 
included approximately 4,115 different campaigns. Louise requsted that we analyze the data from the various campaigns
to provide insight and aid in decision making going-forward. 

# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

An initial look at the data focused on parent categories to examine the makeup of successful campaigns. Theatre was by far the most
successful, followed by music, then film & video. Food and games were both plagued by high failure rates.

We were able to further drill-down the data by creating campaign sub-categories based on their parent categories. The analysis reveals the sheer 
number of Parent Sub-Category:plays is significantly higher than any other  sub-category. They are also the most successful campaigns, when 
considering the number of successful campaigns. Some other notable successful campaigns are documentary, hardware, and rock.

Since they were the most successful, we decided to look at plays to get a deeper understanding of the most successful campaigns. 




We also looked at outcomes based on their launch date to see if there was any correlation between the month the campaign launched and the 
success of the campaign. It was noted that there is a sharp spike in successful campaigns in the spring, leading up to summer, before steadily declining during the winter months.
This would indicate that summer campaigns are more successful than winter campaigns. See chart Outcomes Based on Launch Date.

Another metric that we examined was the length of fundraising campaign and it's correlation to the campaign's success. We were able to 
gain insight on whether campaign length might be tied to its outcome.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
Louise owns Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform that funds and supports various entertainment campaigns all over the world. We were provided data that 
included approximately 4,115 different campaigns. Louise requsted that we analyze the data from the various campaigns
to provide insight and aid in decision making for her company going-forward. 

## Analysis and Challenges
An initial look at the data focused on parent categories to examine the makeup of successful campaigns. Theatre was by far the most
successful, followed by music, then film & video. Food and games were both plagued by high failure rates.

We were able to further drill-down the data by creating campaign subcategories based on their parent categories. The analysis reveals the sheer 
number of Parent Subcategory:plays is significantly higher than any other subcategory. They are also the most successful campaigns, when 
considering the number of successful campaigns. Some other notable successful campaigns are documentary, hardware, and rock.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Since they were the most successful, we decided to look at Parent Category:theatre to get a deeper understanding of the characteristics of 
the most successful campaigns. We also looked at outcomes based on their launch date to see if there was any correlation between the month the campaign launched and the 
success of the campaign. It was noted that there is a sharp spike in successful campaigns in the spring, leading up to summer, before steadily declining during the winter months. This would indicate that summer campaigns were more successful than winter campaigns. Although there were significantly less failed campaigns compared to successful campaigns, the average number of failed campaigns remained relatively steady throughout the year. This would indicate that other factors were at play in determining success vs. failure. There were also very few cancelled theatre campaigns. See chart Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We then decided to look at the Sub-category:plays, as it comprises the vast majority of the Parent Category: theatre. It was speculated that the dollar amount of a campaign's goals may influence the outcome of the campaign. Campaigns were analyzed based on the dollar amount of their respective fundraising goal. The dollar amount of the campaign's goal was broken down into $5,000 increments from less than $1,000 up to anything greater than $50,000. The population consisted of a total number of 1,000 projects, 647 (65%) were successful and 353 (35%) failed. Over half the total projects were considered low-fundraising (<$5,000) campaigns. Those projects reflected an over 70% success rate; clearly indicating that low fundraising goals lead to high success rates. Although, as the fundraising goals increase, the rate of success falls. Once at the $15-$20k goal range, the liklihood of success and failure are the same. There was some success noted in the $30k range, however the sample size was relatively low for the upper end of fundraising goals. In all, it can be reliably determined that lower fundraising goals may have a significant impact on the outcome of a campaign.
